CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:37 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindLIBIGL.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "LIBIGL", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "LIBIGL" with any
  of the following names:

    LIBIGLConfig.cmake
    libigl-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "LIBIGL" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "LIBIGL_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "LIBIGL"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
